Appointment Booking System

This application simulates an appointment booking system for a shared medical practice. The same administrative staff and tooling are used to deal with appointment booking for all of the medical practitioners, for example Dentist, Physiotherapist, General Practitioner, etc.

The reception staff are able to create, view, change, or delete appointments for the patients of any medical practitioners and are able to perform appropriate patient admin tasks.

Patient contact details are stored.

Patients may attend multiple practitioners, for example the same person may attend Dentist and Physiotherapy sessions within the same practice.

Practice Administration staff have all of the abilities of reception staff, and additionally are able to create/update/delete users.

The medical practitioners are only able to see their own appointment bookings. They also are able to call up a history of their appointments for a single patient. They can create notes against the patient for later review.

These notes may contain sensitive information that are only visible to that medical practitioner.

For the initial development, the notes are text but a later extension may consider other formats, e.g. X-Ray imaging.
